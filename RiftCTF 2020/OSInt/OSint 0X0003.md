By doing a reverse search on this picture, we learn that this building is called the "KIDDIE KLOES FACTORY" and is located West Bertsch Street, Lansford Borough, Carbon County.

By rereading the description of the challenge, we realized that it was asked which COUNTY is this building from, and not what country, which explain why riftCTF{usa}, riftCTF{USA} and riftCTF{America} didn't work.

After some guesses over the formating, we got the flag: riftCTF{Carbon_county}

As expected, cybersecurity club IIIT Naya Raipur didn't give any result on LinkedIn.
I tried to put it on google and found a [github page](https://github.com/prince2312yadav/Ciphersite) for the website of the cybersecurity team...But still no name for it. 
By going on the personnal page of the author, prince2312yadav, we find another repository called CyphercellSite with the following describption: *This is the website of CipherCell - The cyber security Club of IIIT Naya Raipur* => we finally have the name of the cybersecurity club!
By searching Ciphercell on linkedin we find their page, a simple *CTRL+F* with *riftCTF{Â¨* and we got the flag: riftCTF{W3lc0me_t0_c1ph3rcell}

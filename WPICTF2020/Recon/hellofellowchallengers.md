While this challenge almost made me pull my hair out, it is actually pretty simple once you accept to be a bit less sceptic.

The second Hint talk to us about a team, a simple search with the string "WPI{" (as implied by the first hint) on the scoreboard and we find a team called "WPI{the\_best\_teams\_make\_the\_flags}"

While I thought at the beginning it might be a team trolling us, trying it proved me it was the real flag. 

**flag** : WPI{the\_best\_teams\_make\_the\_flags}
